Hello! I am Yang Xu, a second-year undergraduate at Zhejiang University. I am majoring in computer science and engineering and I am also a member of ACEE honor program.

My research interests spread broadly in machine learning, including theory and applications. 
1. Theoretical Foundations: I am interested in the theoretical foundations of machine learning, including representation theory, training dynamics, generalization theory, etc. My long-term goal is to build a first-principled understanding of machine learning.
2. Trustworthy Machine Learning and Interpretability: I am interested in improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of machine learning models, including but not limited to, improving interpretability, fairness, robustness and reasoning capabilities via different approaches, like neural-symbolic methods and probabilistic ways.

I believe that these two aspects are closely related and can be mutually beneficial. Understanding the inner mechanisms of machine learning models can help us to build more trustworthy and interpretable models, and conversely, developing empirical models can help us to verify and refine our theoretical understanding.

If you are interested in my research or have any questions, please feel free to contact me through email. I am always open to new ideas and collaborations.
